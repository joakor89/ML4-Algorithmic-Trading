# Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading

Algorithmic trading is not just a modern convenience but a fundamental shift in how financial markets operate. The ability to systematically analyze vast amounts of market data, optimize strategies, and execute trades precisely has revolutionized finance. However, mastering algorithmic trading requires more than technical proficiency; it demands a solid theoretical foundation. Without a deep understanding of the core principles, any attempt to build complex models or deploy advanced strategies is bound to be flawed. Establishing this groundwork ensures that as I progress into more sophisticated aspects of quantitative finance and machine learning, my analyses remain robust, interpretable, and aligned with best practices in the field.

Built upon the principles and exercises outlined in the highly regarded book “Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading” by Stefan Jansen (2020), it provides a structured exploration of this essential framework.

#### Personal Motivation for Advancing in Algorithmic Trading

1.	Building a Solid Foundation in Algorithmic Trading: While I consider my understanding of finance and machine learning models to be advanced at this point, reinforcing the foundational aspects of algorithmic trading remains a logical and prudent approach. Revisiting fundamental principles ensures that my knowledge is both comprehensive and aligned with widely accepted methodologies.

2.	Reassessing Overlooked Fundamentals to Reduce Cognitive Bias: It is common for certain basic concepts to be taken for granted, leading to unnoticed cognitive biases in analysis. By systematically reviewing these foundational elements, I aim to minimize such biases and conduct evaluations based on well-established expert consensus.

3.	Increasing Confidence in Model Development: Confidence in the implementation and validation of algorithmic trading models is crucial, especially when these models influence financial decision-making. Strengthening my grasp of the fundamental principles will reinforce my ability to rigorously evaluate, refine, and apply these models in practice.
